# Welcome to My M and A project

## Task
The task is loading 3 datasets and then we have to clean up them. As well as, creating a dataframe which those cleaned 
datasets should merge. Lastly, convert it into sql(database)

## Description 
My function will be called my_m_and_a and receive the 3 CSV content. Import my function from my_ds_babel to save 
the CSV's content into SQL.

## Installation
- git clone "link"
- pip install requirements.txt
- run my_m_and_a.py 

## Usage
Now, perfectly works. I mean all of functions do on their own duty
